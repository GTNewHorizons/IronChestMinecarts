Hi ganymedes01
 
i have a few questions. In my modpack GT:NH for Minecraft 1.7.10 I use your Iron Chest Minecarts mod.
Since most of the developers have stopped supporting Minecraft 1.7.10, I would like to ask you if i can fork Iron Chest Minecarts and use a custom version for my modpack.
We just want to fix some bugs or make some minor modifications. We'll provide support on our side, and we can put the source code repository privately if you wish.
Iron Chest Minecarts is a nie mod, and we like to continue the work on it for 1.7.10.
Here are some links if you want to know more about my modpack: https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/ and https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack.
Thanks for your attention,
